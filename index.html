		<p> Every day of my life, I strive to learn something new. Whether its reading from a C++ textbook or 
		reading someone's autobiography, listening to podcasts about leadership, watching a youtube video or 
		watching an online lecture, or even just taking on a war game/CTF, I am always learning. I work on
		projects outside of school and work which help me organize aspects of my life or that I simply think are
		cool. This is where most of my skills are obtained.
		</p>
		<p> Currently, I provide IT services to the Columbia Secondary School. My ultimate goal is to end up in 
		an information security role. Over time I hope to figure out the specific niche in the infosec world I 
		would like to work in. One thing is for sure, when I get there I will be ready to face the challenges and continue learning.
