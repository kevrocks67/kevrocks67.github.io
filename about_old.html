    <h2>My Life With Technology</h2>
      <p>My name is Kevin Diaz and I am a freshmen at the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">City College of New York</a>.
        I am currently looking to pursue a B.E. in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>I have been around technology and people who love technology for my entire life. My father was a computer technician, my aunt’s fiancé was a network administrator for Time Warner Cable,
        and my uncle is an enthusiast so by default, I too became like them. I would always watch them repair and build computers so I picked up some of these skills. By the age of 11, I had the
        knowledge to build my own computer. At the time I was extremely ambitious attempting to find ways to make a computer from scratch. When I say scratch, I mean from absolutely nothing. I
        wanted to make the perfect computer since it seemed you could never get exactly what you wanted with the big box companies. Now, I did not end up doing this, but that does not really matter
        because what was important was the interest. It threw me into the world of electronics and computer engineering. Within the next 2 years, I learned arduino, basic bread boarding, and circuit
         theory. This world was fascinating to me and when combined with my computer skills looked like it could become a perfect career. Keep in mind, up to this point I had only learned the skills
          but had no proof for myself that I could physically do it until a day when I saw a few wires, a led, a battery and bread board left out in the engineering room. I finished the do now in less
          than a minute as I usually did, turned to the table and built the circuit in less than 2 minutes. It worked and the feeling of being able to do something after learning it from a view videos
          was amazing. Eventually in this 9th grade class we began programming arduino and learning about circuits. I was ahead of the class which allowed me to finish my projects quickly with my group
          and go on to help other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued my education through youtube picking up different circuit fundamentals, programming theories and computer knowledge. During 10th grade, I finished a compTIA A+ certification course
        at school where I got an A in every test. I then worked from there until my graduation on the school’s tech team helping out with school events and general computer problems around the school. During
        this time I was also asked by my uncle to <s>help him</s> build an android app for a church’s radio station he listens to from the Dominican Republic. The stream was available on tune-in radio but the pastor
        wanted a dedicated app. I of course said yes since at the time I was also taking a class on app development. This was a huge challenge that left me hating java until this day but then again it might
        just be because I never fully learned the basics of the language and solely relied on my basic programming skills adopted from arduino and processing. Most programming languages are similar in functions
        but have different syntaxes for these functions. For example in java and processing you use parentheses and semicolons while in python you use colons and indentations. The app is now on the android play
        store and can be found as "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radioalmacristiana" target="_blank">Radio Alma Cristiana</a>".
      </p>

      <p>The time to figure out if this is what I wanted to do with my life was approaching so I wanted to do a program where all I would do was engineering for a certain amount of time, Blue Stamp Engineering.
        I built an AAA battery phone charger and a RC-tank at this program and had a lot of fun doing it. I picked up soldering skills and lots of troubleshooting skills. You can read more about this on my project
        page linked in the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> of this website.
      </p>

      <p>The fall and spring of that year, I did not do much. I had done an elective for the last 3 years where we made <a href="http://www.seaperch.org/index" target="_blank">underwater robots</a>. This year I was able to be an unofficial teaching assistant. I taught the
        students skills such as how to solder and helped them with their problems in relation to their robots. During this year I also became interested in the idea of building a computer from scratch again, since
        that’s what got me into the electronics world in the first place. I quickly learned that people have done this but to a much smaller scale: 8-bit computers. I learned about architectures, basic binary operations,
        arithmetic logic units, and how to create programs for the computer. It was interesting to learn about but I did not build my own since lots of parts were required which I did not have. The summer after this school
        year, I started the <a href="http://hypothekids.org/hk-maker-lab/">HK Maker Lab</a> program at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>. This is where I would finally be able to put all my skills to use.
      </p>

      <p>In the <a href="http://hypothekids.org/hk-maker-lab/">HK Maker Lab</a> program, I was paired with 3 other people in a group as was every other person in the program. We were tasked with creating a device to solve a
        problem in the medical field. Of course, if we were all just thrown into this project we would have probably failed miserably, so part of the program was also a class taught by Dr. Aaron Kyle, a professor in the
        Biomedical Engineering department who was also the lead
        instructor of the program. In the course we learned basic electronic skills, the engineering process, how to identify problems and needs, finding possible solutions to those problems, prototyping, and how to model a
        business around our solution. During this time we built a few smaller pre-defined projects before we began work on our main project. We built a few amplifier circuits, an EKG monitor as well as an
        <a href="http://hypothekids.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TLP-0243-4I2A1420-e1471890016262.jpg" target="_blank">emg</a> monitor. As for
         my final project, my group decided to work on the problem of over insertion of a needle during IV catheterization. In order to attempt to solve the problem, we built a device to alert the nurse inserting the needle
         of when the needle has gone too far. The device was vacuum based and measured pressure differences to verify the needles location in the arm. The path to this solution was not easy and taught me very important
         troubleshooting skills including patience. It also taught me to be a better leader. No one was made leader of the group officially but since I was the most experienced of the group, I ended up being the leader
         by default once we started building. I had to remember that the people in my group don’t have the same knowledge and skills in electronics as I did and had to learn to be careful with my patience. Knowing how to
         do something and wanting to get it done as quickly as possible was another factor which played into the situation. I had to learn how to not do all the work myself and not make decisions by myself, but to involve
          the entire group and even teach them certain skills so I could delegate certain tasks while I did something else. At the end of the program there was an even where we all pitched our projects to a board of experts
           in the biomedical field and my team won the <a href="src/cathalert_award.jpg" target="_blank">Top Design Award</a> which was the main award everyone was competing for that night. The best part is we were the only
           group that made our entire project using only parts available in the lab rather than using our allocated money.
      </p>

      <p>The fall after this program, my senior year started which was one of the most stressful years in my life, I began exploring the software world a lot more. Senior year meant that I was going to have to do a capstone
         project for my engineering course. I knew that it was going to be a very boring project and class based on the fact that the teacher started the year at basics for the millionth time. I did not like that and took
         matters into my own hand. During the first quarter of the year I read an entire textbook on cyber security. The world had always been of interest to me but I had never learned about it until then. As I read the textbook,
         I learned certain attacks that were vaguely outlined in the book as well as their countermeasures. This led me to see what I could do in class. I created a kali Linux live usb disk and used that whenever I was in class.
         I attempted basic things such as running nmap scans, attempting to crack DVWA using their websites tutorial as well as learning how to carry out certain attacks in more detail. Eventually I realized that I needed something
          more than this so I started thinking about a project. I did not just want a project that was easy, quick or useless. I could have made such a simple project and obtained a 100 in the class but instead I chose the hard route.
           As I stated earlier, I was on the tech team and one of my duties while on the tech team was to move our computer carts from one room to the other. We were usually told in person where to move each cart and when and confusion
           over where each cart was usually arose. So, I decided that I would build a program to manage the carts and their position. The carts were usually left unlocked leaving them vulnerable to theft since there was only one key per
           cart which led me to also attempt to build a system which would unlock and lock the cart without the key. It would be similar to an electronic lock which would communicate with the app. It was a huge project which took the
           entire rest of the year. I literally worked on the project until the very last day my teacher could put in a grade which was after classes had already ended. I did not have time to make the wireless lock system, but I was
            fine with that since I had learned so much doing the programming. I learned 3 programming languages doing this project: <strong>Python, Kivy, and SQL</strong>. More about all my challenges can be read on my github project page linked in
             the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> of this website.
      </p>

      <p>The summer of 2017, I worked in a research laboratory thanks to my time in the HK Maker Lab program. I worked in Dr. Paul Sajda’s <a href="http://liinc.bme.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Lab for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing</a>. Here I
          worked with a graduate student, Pawan Lapborisuth, to use FNIRS (Function Infrared Spectroscopy) to image the brain of a subject making a value based decision.In research papers, EEG or FMRI have been the main choice for brain imaging. The problem
          is that EEG does not provide a good spatial resolution and data can be affected by anything. In fact, because of this, we had to remove 2 power adaptors from the room by using DC extension cords because it was causing too much noise in the data. As
          for FMRI, the subject must be completely still and it is very expensive to operate. With FNIRS, these problems are mostly solved. While at the lab, I helped my mentor with the initial use and testing of the machine. We collected data from a smaller
          version of the goal experiment and analyzed it in NIRS SPM, a toolkit for Matlab, to make sure that the machine was working and the experiment could deliver viable data.  During this time, I had to do a lot of troubleshooting with the software as a
          lot of the code was old and did not work with the newer version of Matlab. I fixed the program and was able to successfully process the data because of it. As written by my mentor, “The goal of the project is to investigate the neural correlates
          associated with a value based decision making task using different brain imaging technologies. While previous studies have looked into such topics, the typical imaging modalities are EEG and FMRI. By adding FNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy)
          into the mix, we are hoping to discover additional information from this experiment.” To explore the neural correlates associated with value based decision making, we employed an experimental paradigm in which the subject is asked to make a decision on
          what they think will win from 2 different choices of shapes. The quantity of the type of shape is a random number from 1 to 4. The amount of the specific shape you choose is the amount of points you can obtain. For example, if you choose the side with
          4 triangles instead of the side with 3 squares and you won, you will win 4 points. After the subject does this they are notified whether or not they won. We recently ran this gambling task approximately 20 times per run with 2 runs per subject. The goal
          is to have a longer version of this paradigm with more subjects and eventually be able to run it while using a combination of FNIRS and EEG at the same time. Overall, I enjoyed my time in the lab as I learned a lot of things about a realm of STEM I had
          never explored. It also gave me a feel for what working in a research lab is like.
