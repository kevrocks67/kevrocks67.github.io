Normally, there is no website when I go to my debian server's IP address in my browser. However,
I have a web server running in a QEMU VM on that server and would like to access it from my
laptop. After following the steps in this guide, I am able to access that web server by going to
the IP of my debian server as if it was installed on the server itself. Unless you give the VM
its own real IP address from the router, we cannot access that VM from another computer. That
being said we may not want to give the VM its own TAP and IP address. The alternative is to
forward all requests to the host computer on a specific port to the port on the VM for the
service you want to access. I used iptables to do this port forwarding just like we do port
forwarding on our home routers. Our routers use NAT to do port forwarding allowing us to access
services in our homes from across the internet. We can replicate this in our VM's
with the below iptables rules.
</p>

<b>NOTE:</b>In the case described below, 192.168.1.250 is the IP address of the debian server
and 192.168.122.215 is the ip address of the VM. Both of these devices are on a /24 subnet.
The interface on which the debian server connects to my home network is enp2s0.

First we enable this NAT functionality by setting the MASQUERADE option.

<pre>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE</pre>

Then, we set a PREROUTING rule which lets the host device detect any incoming connections on port
80 for our network interface and redirect it to the VM's IP address on port 80 instead of
attempting to connect to the hosts own port 80.

<pre>
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.1.250/24 -i enp2s0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT \
--to-destination 192.168.122.215:80
</pre>

Finally, we set a FORWARD rule which ensures the packet actually gets sent to port 80 on the VM and
that the VM is open to accepting that packet.

<pre>
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.122.215/24 --dport 80 -m state --state \
NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
</pre>
