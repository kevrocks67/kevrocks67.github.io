  Recently, I was asked to access data from a HDD which was previously inside of a WD My Book
  Live enclosure. I encountered a problem when attempting to mount the HDD on my Linux machine.
  The drive appeared as a block device with 4 partitions. The first 2 partitions showed as
  "linux_raid_member", the third appeared as swap and the fourth which was the biggest
  partition, presumably holding the data, appeared as ext4. Here is a picture of what I saw with
  <i>lsblk</i>:

  When I attempted to mount the 1.8T ext4 partition it would give me a "wrong fs type" error
  message. The first thing I wondered was whether the filesystem was corrupt and I ran
  <i>e2fsck</i>.
  It found some errors, however, I could still not mount the drive.
<p>

<p>
  Noticing that I could still not mount the drive, I attempted to get at the data using
  <i>debugfs</i>.  I was finally able to see the folders inside the filesystem. At this point I
  understood two things. One, the data still exists and is potentially uncorrupted and two,
  there was something else funny going on with the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
  My next step was to run <i>dmesg</i> to see if there was anything of use in there. What I found
  was a bunch of errors referencing block size. This was something new to me. I began to do some
  googling and found that apparently mount has problems mounting filesystems with a blocksize
  over 4096. I began to investigate the filesystem further using an assortment of tools. Both
  <i>dumpe2fs</i> and <i>tune2fs</i> told me that I was dealing with a block size of 65536. This
  was shocking to discover as I had never really seen different block sizes being used,
  especially not one so large. I also attempted to retrieve the blocksize using <i>blockdev</i>,
  however, for some reason I got a 4096 blocksize which I knew was incorrect. I am not entirely
  sure why this was. Below are pictures of the results.

  Upon further research I learned that the kernel has had an ongoing problem of dealing with
  <a target="_blank" href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Design_for_Large_Allocation_Blocks">large block sizes</a>.
  It has to do with page size not being large enough, since its 4096 by default on
  most machines, along with other misconfigured parameters in the kernel. The solution to be
  able to retrieve this data is to either modify your kernel parameters to account for this new
  block size, which is not necessarily realistic all the time, or to use another solution I
  found, <i>fuseext2</i>.  It will know how to handle the weird block size and will allow you to
  retrieve your data.

  The issue of block size is an interesting one. WD most likely chose this bigger block size
  since this is a drive meant for backups. What this means is potentially big files being
  transferred. A larger block size can provide better performance for such a situation.
