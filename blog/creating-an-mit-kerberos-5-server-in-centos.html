<p>
Kerberos is an authentication protocol which is very commonly used throughout the world. It is
most commonly seen through its implementation in Microsoft Active Directory. However, MIT has an
implementation of the Kerberos protocol, krb5, which we can use on Linux. It uses symmetric
encryption combined with a ticket based system in order to securely authenticate users. I will
not spend much time describing the protocol as there are existing resources such as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N242XcKAsM" target=_blank>this one</a> which explain it and the
terminology in this article very well.
</p>
<p>
MIT krb5 can be used as a standalone product or can be integrated with a LDAP server, such
as OpenLDAP, as a backend. In this article, I will only discuss krb5 as a standalone
authentication product. In this configuration, there will be no identity tied to the Kerberos
Ticket provided other than the User Principal Name (UPN). If you want a full identiy and
authentication solution you should integrate krb5 with LDAP.
</p>
<p>
The main components of the krb5 server are the Key Distribution Center (KDC), the kadmin server,
the database and the keytab file. The KDC is the main server and kadmin is the server that allows
you to manage principals in the database as well as manage the keytab. There is also an
additional service that is running as part of the kadmin service which is kpasswd. This allows
users to reset their password using the kpasswd utility.
</p>

<h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Set a proper hostname</li>
  <pre>
  hostnamectl set-hostname kerberos.kevco.virt
  </pre>

  <li>Ensure time is synced using an NTP server</li>
  <p>
  By default, CentOS should have chronyd started and enabled, however, you may want to set up
  an ntpd server. It is very important that the kerberos server and clients have their time
  synced up. Otherwise, you will have problems authenticating.
  </p>

  <li>yum install krb5-server krb5-libs krb5-workstation</li>

  <li>Edit <i>/etc/krb5.conf</i>
  <p>Uncomment and replace all lines with references
  to the example domain and realm. The standard realm name convention is to use your domain name
  capitalized.  Below you will find an example config declaring the realm <i>KEVCO.VIRT</i> on a
  machine with the hostname <i>kerberos.kevco.virt</i>.</li>
  <pre>
  [logging]
   default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
   kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
   admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

  [libdefaults]
   default_realm = KEVCO.VIRT
   dns_lookup_realm = false
   dns_lookup_kdc = false
   ticket_lifetime = 24h
   renew_lifetime = 7d
   forwardable = true
   rdns = false

  [realms]
   KEVCO.VIRT = {
     kdc = kerberos.kevco.virt
     admin_server = kerberos.kevco.virt
   }

  [domain_realm]
   .kevco.virt = KEVCO.VIRT
   kevco.virt = KEVCO.VIRT
 </pre>
 Here I set the log file locations in the logging section. In the libdefaults section, the default
 realm is set to KEVCO.VIRT as you can define multiple realms for a KDC. I disabled DNS lookup
 as there is no DNS server in this scenario. I also disabled rdns since reverse DNS is not set
 up in this scenario (because there is no DNS server). Finally, I declared the realm KEVCO.VIRT
 and provided the hostnames for the kdc and kadmin server which happens to be this same machine.
 The final section simply defines translations from domain name to realm name. For any
 additional information check <i>man krb5.conf</i> or <a
 href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html#libdefaults"
 target=_blank>MIT documentation</a>.</p>
 </li>

 <li>Edit <i>/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf</i></li>
 <p>
   This is the file that holds the main configuration for your KDC. Replace the example realm
   with your own and set any other options you would like. Below is an example of a config you can
   use. For available options reference the
   <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/kdc_conf.html"
   target=_blank>documentation</a>. In this example, I leave the default encryption types
   enabled, however, you may want to disable the likes of des, des3, and RC4 in favor of AES if
   possible.
 </p>
 <pre>
 [kdcdefaults]
 kdc_ports = 88
 kdc_tcp_ports = 88

 [realms]
  KEVCO.VIRT = {
   master_key_type = aes256-cts
   acl_file = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
   dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
   admin_keytab = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
   supported_enctypes = aes256-cts:normal aes128-cts:normal des3-hmac-sha1:normal arcfour-hmac:normal des-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-md5:normal des-cbc-crc:normal
  }
 </pre>

 <li>Edit <i>/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdm5.acl</i>
   <p>
    This is the ACL file that determines who will be able to do which actions on the kadmin
    server. You should add permissions for the admin/admin service principal as can be seen
    below. Without this, you will not be able to do anything on the server remotely, including
    pulling down the keys into the keytab of a client. In order to restrict permissions down to
    certain actions see the <a
    href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/kadm5_acl.html"
    target=_blank>documentation</a>.
   </p>
 <pre>
 admin/admin@KEVCO.VIRT   *
 </pre>

 <li>Create the kerberos database</li>
 <pre>
 kdb5_util create -s
 </pre>

 <li>Create the admin service principal</li>
 <pre>
 kadmin.local -q "addprinc admin/admin"
 </pre>

 <li>Start and enable the kdc and kadmin</li>
 <pre>
 systemctl start krb5kdc kadmin
 systemctl enable krb5kdc kadmin
 </pre>

 <li>Create a service principal for this computer with a random key and add the keys to the local
 keytab</li>
 <p>All systems that you want to use kerberos authentication should have a service principal
 (SPN). The standard is <i>host/hostname_in_dns</i>. You can add multiple principals as aliases
 if you have more than one name for your machine.
 You must have your own keys stored in your local keytab. You will also need to add that clients
 own generated keys from their SPN to their keytab if you want things to work properly.
 </p>
 <pre>
 kadmin -p admin/admin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kerberos.kevco.virt"
 kadmin -p admin/admin -q "ktadd host/kerberos.kevco.virt"
 </pre>

 <li>Create your own principal and give it whatever access you need in the kadm5.acl file</li>
 <pre>
 kadmin -p admin/admin -q "addprinc kdiaz"
 </pre>

 <li>Create a test ticket using kinit</li>
 <p>You need to get a ticket using kinit for an existing principal (admin in this case) and
 then you can view it and other stored tickets using klist. Finally, you can destroy this ticket
 and remove it from the cache using kdestroy.
 </p>
 <pre>
 kinit kdiaz
 klist
 kdestroy -A
 </pre>

 <li>Open the proper ports in the firewall
   <p>
     Port 88 needs to be open primarily on 88/udp. However, you also need to open 88/tcp as
     kerberos will use this if the Tickets get too big. Other ports include 749/tcp for the
     kadmin server and 464/udp for the kpasswd service.
   </p>
 <pre>
   for port in {88/tcp,88/udp,749/tcp,464/udp};do
     firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port $port;done
   firewall-cmd --reload
 </pre>
 </li>
 <li>(Optional) Add DNS SRV records</li>
 <p>
 If you have DNS configured in your environment you should add records for your kerberos server.
 The record names are self explanatory/if you are doing this you likely know what youre
 doing.
 <pre>
 $ORIGIN _tcp.kevco.virt.
 _kerberos-adm    SRV 0 0 749 kerberos.kevco.virt.
 _kerberos        SRV 0 0 88  kerberos.kevco.virt.

 $ORIGIN _udp.kevco.virt.
 _kerberos        SRV 0 0 88  kerberos.kevco.virt.
 _kerberos-master SRV 0 0 88  kerberos.kevco.virt.
 _kpasswd         SRV 0 0 464 kerberos.kevco.virt.
