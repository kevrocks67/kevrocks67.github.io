<h1>QEMU Host Only Networking</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#qemu-host-only-networking'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='qemu-host-only-networking.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
Often times, it is useful to use a host-only network in a lab environment, especially when
dealing with certain security labs. What a host-only network allows is for your virtual machines
to communicate with each other on their own independent network and communicate to the host
computer/hypervisor. However, the VM's will not be able to reach out to other devices on your
network and devices on your network will not be able to reach them. In order to set up this
isolated environment, you need to create a bridge and tap just like any other VM networking set
up. There are two methods to do this, one is manually and the other automatically using the
libvirt XML format.
</p>

<h3>Libvirt XML Method</h3>
<p>
In order to do this the easy way, you can create an XML file whose contents are the below.
This is simply the default network setup but without the forward tags. This makes it so the
network is limited to the virtual environment. I renamed the bridge to "virbr1" instead of the
default "virbr0" so there is no conflict. I also changed the last byte of the mac address and set
an appropriate DHCP range and IP address as to not interfere with the other network. Here I simply
changed the IP from the 192.168.122.0/24 subnet to 192.168.123.0/24. In the DHCP range, do not
forget to leave out the .255 address since this IP is used for broadcast.
Finally, I changed the name to secnet to help me identify it. I called it
that because this is the network I use for security labs, often with vulnerable
systems, which I want no where near my real network.
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;network&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;secnet&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;uuid&gt;8f49de66-0947-4271-85a4-2bbe88913555&lt;/uuid&gt;
      &lt;bridge name='virbr1' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
      &lt;mac address='52:54:00:95:26:26'/&gt;
      &lt;ip address='192.168.123.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'&gt;
        &lt;dhcp&gt;
          &lt;range start='192.168.123.30' end='192.168.123.254'/&gt;
        &lt;/dhcp&gt;
      &lt;/ip&gt;
    &lt;/network&gt;
</pre>

After creating this file, simply run <i>virsh net-define file_name.xml</i> and <i>virsh net-start
file_name</i>. If all is well you have officially set up the network and can configure the client.
You can do this either through virt-manager by changing the NIC settings from the default
networks bridge to your bridge, in this case, virbr1, or you can do <i>virsh edit domain</i> and
look for a line with &lt;interface type='bridge'&gt; and modify the value for source. If you
have no NIC set up at all, add the following lines to your code, modifying certain values such
as the mac address and pci slot under the address tag as necessary. When you boot up the client
it should automatically get a DHCP address.

<pre>
    &lt;interface type='bridge'&gt;
      &lt;mac address='52:54:00:8c:d0:7e'/&gt;
      &lt;source bridge='virbr1'/&gt;
      &lt;model type='virtio'/&gt;
      &lt;address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x08' function='0x0'/&gt;
    &lt;/interface&gt;
</pre>
</P>

<h3>Manual Method</h3>
 <p>
Although you can do the above method and have it work well, there are times when you want to
learn what actually happens behind the scenes and how it all works. In order to do this, you have
to understand that the virtual network is made up of a bridge and a tap where the tap acts as a
virtual NIC for the VM. The bridge is what hosts the network and acts as a router. We need to
create this bridge, assign it an IP, then create the tap and make the bridge a slave of the tap.
At this point, a functioning network will be established with static IP addresses. If you want
DHCP, you can do so using dnsmasq. Finally, add the appropriate settings to the VM as described
above in the XML method. From there on out, everything else is simply a matter of
configuring the client itself. The only negative to this manual method is that you have to start
and stop the network manually, but this is easily scriptable.
</p>

<pre>
    # Create the virtual bridge and name it secnet and bring the interface up
    sudo ip link add secnet type bridge; sudo ip link set secnet up

    # Create the tap and name it secnet-nic (you can call it whatever you want)
    sudo ip tuntap add dev secnet-nic mode tap

    # Bring up the interface in promiscuous mode
    sudo ip link set secnet-nic up promisc on

    # Make secnet-nic a slave of secnet
    sudo ip link set secnet-nic master secnet

    # Give bridge secnet an IP address of 192.168.123.1
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.123.1/24 broadcast 192.168.123.255 dev secnet
</pre>

<b>DHCP With dnsmasq</b>
<p>
Setting up DHCP with dnsmasq is simple. You can either write out the config within the command,
as is shown below, or you can create a config file which you can read from, also shown below.
The important steps in running dnsmasq are setting the correct interface and DHCP range as well
as setting the -p option to 0. When the -p option is set to 0, the DNS function of dnsmasq will
no longer start which removes conflicts with any active DNS servers on your host computer. I
have this problem since I use dnscrypt on my laptop, however, you may not encounter such
conflict. There is no real need to host our own DNS server so nothing is lost by doing this.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The secnet config provided below was generated by libvirt when using the XML method
taught in this blog.

<pre>
    sudo dnsmasq --interface secnet -p 0 --bind-interfaces --dhcp-range=192.168.123.10,192.168.123.254

    or

    sudo dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/secnet.conf --leasefile-ro

    # secnet.conf
    strict-order
    pid-file=test.pid
    except-interface=lo
    bind-dynamic
    interface=secnet
    dhcp-option=3
    no-resolv
    ra-param=*,0,0
    dhcp-range=192.168.123.30,192.168.123.254,255.255.255.0
    dhcp-no-override
    dhcp-authoritative
    dhcp-lease-max=225
    dhcp-hostsfile=test.hostsfile
    addn-hosts=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.addnhosts
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you did not set up DHCP using dnsmasq you will have to manually set up the IP
and default gateway route on the client. It is simply two lines if you use the command line
and a few changes within the settings panel of whatever desktop environment you're using in the
vm.
</p>

<pre>
    # Assign an ip address to the interface
    ip addr add 192.168.123.2/24 dev eth0

    # Add the default gateway route which is the secnet address
    route add default gw 192.168.123.1 eth0

    # Test network connectivity
    ping 1.1.1.1

    # There is no DNS assigned so you have to manually add a server in resolv.conf
    echo 1.1.1.1 > /etc/resolv.conf

    # Final network connectivity test with DNS resolution
    ping google.com
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you followed all the steps in this guide, you will have successfully created an isolated
host-only network. To confirm this, try pinging a device in your network such as your phone.
This should not work, but you should be able to ping the host computer at 192.168.123.1 and
other VM's on the same network.
