  Google's G-Suite has been dominating the field of cloud suite services for a long time in both
  the enterprise and the education world. It is a strong competitor to options such as Microsoft
  Office 365. Not only can it offer mail, storage, and other related apps which users expect,
  but it can also offer lots of features to help administrators. It has a very useful interface
  for centrally managing all of your chromebook devices which has become a large part of the
  technology used in the education space. It is already essentially an identification service.
  Google allows us to use this identification service for devices other than chromebooks and
  apps through Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). In this blog post, I will discuss how
  I managed to set up SSSD to provide authentication via G Suite secure LDAP. This allows for the
  use of G Suite instead of having to duplicate all your users into a Microsoft Active
  Directory server simply for authentication or paying for a service. For the sake of brevity,
  I will only be showing how I did this in CentOS 7. However, it is really easy to adapt these
  instructions to the distro of your choice. The only real differences will most likely be related
  to installing the software and configuring SE Linux (since it is not enabled on all distros).
</p>

<h3>Installing required packages</h3>
<pre>
yum install sssd sssd-tools sssd-utils unzip
</pre>

<h3>Generating Cert and Key in G Suite</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open your G Suite Console</li>
  <li>Navigate to Apps>LDAP</li>
  <li>Click on "Add Client"</li>
  <li>Give the client a name</li>
  <li>Either allow access to everyone in the organization or restrict it to certain org units</li>
  <li>Allow read permissions for both users and groups</li>
  <li>Click "Add LDAP Client"</li>
  <li>Download the zip file containing the cert and key</li>
  <li>Enable the creds by switching the LDAP client to "on" under "Service status"</li>
  <li>Upload the zip file to the client and unzip it</li>
  <li>Move the files somewhere such as /var/lib</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring sssd.conf</h3>
<p>
In order to set up /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, its easiest to copy the default config that google
recommends and work off of that. You can find it
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9089736?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> under the SSSD tab.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to replace the domain and location of the cert and key. After doing this, we do have
to add a few other things so that we can better integrate SSSD as an authentication service
across the system. Under the "sssd" section, add sudo at the end of the services option so that we can
allow sudo to work with our domain creds. The next thing you can do is modify some settings for
offline login. You can create a "pam" section and set numbers for
"offline_credentials_expiration", "offline_failed_login_attempts", and
"offline_failed_login_delay". These are the options that I have set in my VM, but there are a
lot more you can use. Refer to the man page for sssd.conf or the Red Hat documentation linked in
the testing section
to see what else you can do. Finally, we have to make sure the system will be usable and that
the user will not encounter any errors on login. We do this by setting two options to True in the
"domain/YOUR_DOMAIN.com" section. The first option is "create_homedir" which ensures that the
user will have a home directory created for them when they log in. The other option is
"auto_private_groups" which helps with UID and GID errors that may occur since the UID and GID
are set from G Suite instead of being locally stored in /etc/passwd. Below you will find the file
I used to test in my VM. I replaced my actual domain with "yourdomain.com".
</p>

<pre>
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf


[sssd]
services = nss,pam,sudo
domains = yourdomain.com

[domain/yourdomain.com]
ldap_tls_cert = /var/lib/ldapcreds.crt
ldap_tls_key = /var/lib/ldapcreds.key
ldap_uri = ldaps://ldap.google.com
ldap_search_base = dc=yourdomain,dc=com
id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
ldap_schema = rfc2307bis
ldap_user_uuid = entryUUID
ldap_groups_use_matching_rule_in_chain = true
ldap_initgroups_use_matching_rule_in_chain = true
create_homedir = True
auto_private_groups = true

[pam]
offline_credentials_expiration = 2
offline_failed_login_attempts = 3
offline_failed_login_delay = 5
</pre>

<h3>Configuring nsswitch.conf</h3>
<pre>authconfig --enablesssd --enablesssdauth --enablemkhomedir --updateall</pre>
Open /etc/nsswitch.conf and add the line <pre>sudoers:    files sss</pre>
Everything else should have been configured by the authconfig command.

<h3>Permissions and SE Linux</h3>
<pre>
setenforce 0
chcon -t sssd_t ldapcreds.crt
chcon -t sssd_t ldapcreds.key
setenforce 1
chmod 0600 /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
</pre>
If you are having problems getting things to work after attempting it this way, just disable SE Linux

<h3>Enable and start everything</h3>
<pre>
sudo systemctl start sssd
sudo systemctl enable sssd
</pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to test if everything is working is to su into your user account on your domain
and see if you can log in using your password. If this works, you should have a home folder created
in /home and be able to try a sudo command. By default, it will say you are not allowed to run
sudo since your account is not in the sudoers file. The easiest way to give access to sudo commands
is to give a group permissions to do things. Your google groups will work just as if you were giving
a local group sudo access. However, you can still just give individual users access the same
way.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use sssctl to do a lookup on a user account in your domain. It is done as
follows:
<pre>sssctl user-checks USERNAME</pre>
This and so many other tools and functionalities can be found in Red Hat's
<a
href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/index"
target="_blank">System-level Authentication Guide</a>.

If you are having problems make sure to check your /etc/sssd/sssd.conf config file so that it is
accurate and has the proper permissions of 0600. Additionally, make sure that SE Linux is not
causing you problems. Any other debugging can be done through reading of man pages (sssd,
sssd.conf, etc), googling, and looking at
google's <a href="https://support.google.com/a/topic/9048334?hl=en&ref_topic=7556782"
target="_blank">Support Center</a> page for Secure LDAP.
