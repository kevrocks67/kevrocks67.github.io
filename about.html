      <p>
        I am an IT Specialist at the Columbia Secondary School in New York. Working at the same
        school I graduated from and in the same IT department I volunteered at for almost 2
        years is great. I work on everything from managing the G Suite domain to repairing
        damaged computers to running lights (DMX) and AV equipment for events. I run, maintain,
        and document as well as look for ways to improve our teams efficiency. I love working in
        this field.
     </p>
     <p>
        I have been around technology and people who love technology for my entire life. My father was a computer technician, my aunt’s fiancé was a network administrator for Time Warner Cable,
        and my uncle is a tech enthusiast so by default, I too became like them. I would always watch them repair and build computers, so I picked up some of those skills. By the age of 11, I had the
        knowledge to build my own computer. At the time I was extremely ambitious attempting to find ways to make a computer from scratch. When I say scratch, I mean from absolutely nothing. I
        wanted to make the perfect computer with the perfect motherboard since it seemed you could never get exactly what you wanted with the big box companies. Now, I did not end up doing this, but
        that does not really matter because what was important was the interest. It threw me into the world of electronics and computer engineering. Within the next 2 years, I learned arduino, basic
        breadboarding, and circuit theory. This world was fascinating to me and led me to a desire of always digging deeper to understand how things work.
     </p>
     <p>
        I spend my time watching lectures, talks, and youtube videos to learn new concepts
        and programming languages. I also read books and as I learn these new concepts I try to
        create small projects or do small practice labs to cement in the knowledge. I also
        sometimes learn just to know the basics about certain things which can be useful for doing
        war games and CTF's. Although I am interested in security, I slowed down my learning in
        that area to focus on the fundamental concepts. By getting a good understanding of the
        fundamentals of how a network function or how an enterprise environment goes together, I
        am finding that I am better able to understand the security concepts and why certain
        defenses may or may not work.
     </p>
     <p>
        Currently I am working on the compTIA Network+ content to take the exam. As I work on
        this I am also occasionally working on RHCSA/RHCE content. I use arch linux as my main
        OS, have a debian server at home running shoutcast, and have my CentOS 7 lab environment,
        so studying for the Red Hat exams is an almost consistent thing for me. After I take
        the Network+, I plan to start studying for the Security+.
