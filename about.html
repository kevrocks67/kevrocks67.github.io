      <p>My name is Kevin Diaz and I am a freshmen at the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">City College of New York</a>.
        I am currently looking to pursue a B.E. in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>I have been around technology and people who love technology for my entire life. My father was a computer technician, my aunt’s fiancé was a network administrator for Time Warner Cable,
        and my uncle is an enthusiast so by default, I too became like them. I would always watch them repair and build computers so I picked up some of these skills. By the age of 11 I had the
        knowledge to build my own computer. At the time I was extremely ambitious attempting to find ways to make a computer from scratch. When I say scratch, I mean from absolutely nothing. I
        wanted to make the perfect computer since it seemed you could never get exactly what you wanted with the big box companies. Now, I didn’t end up doing this, but that does not really matter
        because what was important was the interest. It threw me into the world of electronics and computer engineering. Within the next 2 years, I learned arduino, basic bread boarding, and circuit
         theory. This world was fascinating to me and when combined with my computer skills looked like it could become a perfect career. Keep in mind, up to this point I had only learned the skills
          but had no proof for myself that I could physically do it until a day when I saw a few wires, a led, a battery and bread board left out in the engineering room. I finished the do now in less
          than a minute as I usually did, turned to the table and built the circuit in less than 2 minutes. It worked and the feeling of being able to do something after learning it from a view videos
          was amazing. Eventually in this 9th grade class we began programming arduino and learning about circuits. I was ahead of the class which allowed me to finish my projects quickly with my group
          and go on to help other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued my education through youtube picking up different circuit fundamentals, programming theories and computer knowledge. During 10th grade, I finished a compTIA A+ certification course
        at school where I got an A in every test. I then worked from there until my graduation on the school’s tech team helping out with school events and general computer problems around the school. During
        this time I was also asked by my uncle to help him build an android app for a church’s radio station he listens to from the Dominican Republic. The stream was available on tune-in radio but the pastor
        wanted a dedicated app. I of course said yes since at the time I was also taking a class on app development. This was a huge challenge that left me hating java until this day but then again it might
        just be because I never fully learned the basics of the language and solely relied on my basic programming skills adopted from arduino and processing. Most programming languages are similar in functions
        but have different syntaxes for these functions. For example in java and processing you use parentheses and semicolons while in python you use colons and indentations. The app is now on the android play
        store and can be found as “Radio Alma Cristiana”.
      </p>

      <p>The time to figure out if this is what I wanted to do with my life was approaching so I wanted to do a program where all I would do was engineering for a certain amount of time, Blue Stamp Engineering.
        I built an AAA battery phone charger and a RC-tank at this program and had a lot of fun doing it. I picked up soldering skills and lots of troubleshooting skills. You can read more about this on my project
        page linked in the projects page of this website.
