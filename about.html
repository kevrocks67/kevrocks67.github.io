      <p>
        I am an IT Specialist at the Columbia Secondary School in New York. Working at
        the same school I graduated from and in the same IT department I volunteered
        at for almost 2 years is great. I work on everything from managing the G Suite
        domain to repairing damaged computers to running lights (DMX) and AV equipment
        for events. I run, maintain, and document as well as look for ways to improve
        our teams efficiency. I love working in this field.
     </p>

     <p>
     I am also a student at the
     <a target=_blank href="http://jjay.cuny.edu">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a>
     where I am working on a Bachelors in Computer Science and Information Security. I
     have also had the chance to take part in several cybercrime classes where I have
     learned about the criminology and laws behind the malicious actors we fight
     today.
     </p>

     <p>
        I have been around technology and people who love technology for my entire
        life. People in my family worked in or loved technology. I would always watch
        them repair and build computers, so I picked up some of those skills. By the
        age of 11, I had the knowledge to build my own computer. At the time, I was
        extremely ambitious in attempting to find ways to make a computer from
        scratch. When I say scratch, I mean from absolutely nothing. I wanted to make
        the perfect computer with the perfect motherboard since it seemed you could
        never get exactly what you wanted with the big box companies. Now, I did not
        end up doing this - of course, but that does not really matter because what
        was important was the interest. It threw me into the world of electronics and
        computer engineering.  Within the next 2 years, I learned arduino, basic
        breadboarding, and circuit theory. This world was fascinating to me and led me
        to a mindset of always digging deeper to understand how things work. This
        mindset is what has helped me become who I am today.
     </p>
     <p>
        I spend my time watching lectures, talks, and youtube videos to learn new
        technological concepts. I also read books and as I
        learn these new concepts I try to create small programming projects or do small practice
        labs to cement in the knowledge. I also occasionally will write a
        <a href="https://kevindiaz.dev/blog.html" target=_blank>blog post</a> about
        it. When im not learning, I spend my time helping out people in and
        moderating/administering the
        <a href="https://youtube.com/engineerman" target=_blank>Engineer Man</a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/itcareerquestions" target=_blank>IT Career Questions</a>
        communities on Discord and Youtube. In both communities, we seek to help
        people get into the tech field and network with other people already in the
        field. We help them find resources to learn things and solve any technological
        issues they may be facing. The Engineer Man community is focused on primarily
        programming, while the ITCQ community is focused on the IT field directly.

        I became really interested in information security in early 2016 after reading
        an old book on my dad's shelf called "Hacking Exposed". As I dug
        deeper into the field and started playing around with things, I realized I did
        not fully understand many things and decided I needed (and wanted) to learn
        more about the fundamentals of IT infrastucture and administration.
        <br>
        By getting a good understanding of how a network functions or how an
        enterprise environment goes together, I am finding that I am better able to
        understand the security concepts and why certain defenses may or may not work.
        I know that this time is well spent and will lead to me becoming a much better
        security expert than I could have ever been had I not gone down this path.
